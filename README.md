## Abstract
This work is realized as part of the Coursera Data Science Specialization proposed by the Johns Hopkins University. The aim of the project is to build a tidy data set by using the [programming language R](https://www.rstudio.com/) and determine which are the worst weather events responsible of the majority of the people health and economy damages in the US.

## Context of the project
Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.
